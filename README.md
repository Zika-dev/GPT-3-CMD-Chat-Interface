# GPT-3-CMD-Chat-Interface
A command line interface for talking to GPT-3. Made in python.

This is just a simple project i made for fun, it's not very advanced.

# HOW TO USE

- You can type "s" to save your conversation with a name

- You can type "l" to load a conversation that you have saved

- You can type "x" to exit the program

# KEY

You will be prompted to enter your key when you open the program without a settings file. After you enter your key it will save in a file called "key.ini" and will load from that file everytime you start the program again so that you wont have to retype your key everytime you use the program.
